# Lab 7
### Improved visualization
[Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/X6JRWW63B?:display_count=yes)



### Critique on visualization of Lab 3

1. The title I wrote **'Citigroup stock prices are not affected by security breaches'** did not refute the claim very clearly
 
1. Where the security breaches happened are not clearly shown on the visualization

1. Too many words in the summary section

1. Y axis is actually not very useful and ugly


### Roadmap for improvement

1. Changed the title to directly refute the claim **'The financial markets do not punish security breaches.'**

1. Add some annotation to indicate where the security breaches happened and they did not affect the stock price  so that we can not say financial markets punishes security breaches.

1. Remove the summary section and infuse the words to the newly added annotation area 

1. Remove the y axis


### How have I improved the visualization

1. Visualization title is changed to **Financial Market Does Not Punish Security Breaches (take Citigroup stock closing Price as an example)**

1. Add annotation area to suggest where the security breaches happened

1. Different color between financial crisis and security breaches area to indicate the difference

1. Remove the wordy  summary and let viewer to see the price changes and compare in their mind
