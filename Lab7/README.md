### Improved visualization

### Critique on visualization of Lab 3

1. Original Visualization  **'Citigroup stock prices are not affected by security breaches'** made a claim base on one example. It is not very convincing.
 
1. Where the security breaches happened are not clearly shown on the original visualization

1. Too many words in the summary section

1. Y axis is actually not very useful and ugly


### Roadmap for improvement

1. Changed the title to directly refute the claim **'Financial markets did not punish security breaches.'**

1. Add Equifax's visualization to display a different reaction for comparison and wrote **'Financial Markets did punish security breaches'**

1. Add some annotation to indicate where the security breaches happened and they did not affect the stock price or they did.

1. Put two visualizations in one Dashboard


### How have I improved the visualization

1. Made a dashboar and compare the two reactions and let audience to decide

1. Add annotation area to suggest where the security breaches happened

1. Different color between financial crisis and security breaches area to indicate the difference

1. Removed the wordy  summary and let viewer to see the price changes and compare in their mind
